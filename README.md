# Most popular React UI libraries performance comparison

Project has been create through the [create-vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite) util.

## Libraries which has been chosen:
 + [Antd v5](**https://ant.design/**)
 + [Material UI v5](**https://mui.com/material-ui/**)
 + [Chakra UI v2](**https://chakra-ui.com/**)
 + [React-bootstrap v2 (under bootstrap v5)](**https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/**)
 + Simple custom UI-kit

## Component tests
Currently each library tries to render 1000 simple basic components (Button & Typography). It's pretty synthetic test, but I believe it could give you some vision about this libraries usage cost, and especially about CSS-in-JS approach.
